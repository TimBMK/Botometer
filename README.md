# Botometer

This was my first R Project, back in 2017. It resulted in a paper for a university course on Web Scraping held by Carsten Schwemmer at the Humboldt University Berlin.

I scraped more than 2,000,000 Tweets surrounding the German Federal Elections in 2017, using an Amazon Lightsail Server and Twitter's Stream API. Then, I built a function to access the OSoMe Botometer API (https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/). The API was accessed via the Mashape Platform (now RapidAPI): https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer-pro

For the final paper, I reproduced some of the analyses conducted in
Bessi, Alessandro, und Emilio Ferrara. 2016. „Social Bots Distort the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election Online Discussion“. First Monday 21 (11). https://doi.org/10.5210/fm.v21i11.7090.
